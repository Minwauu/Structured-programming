## Selection

- Structured programming is only possible because thes tructures are built in to programming languages like Python, Java, VB and C#.

- Structured programming is a method of writing a computer program which uses:
  - Top down analysis for problem solving
  - Modularization for program structure and organisation
  - Structured code for the indiviual modules
  -
